List out the features of HTML5.

->HTML5, the fifth version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessor, HTML4. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:

Semantic Elements:- HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and more, which help define the structure and meaning of content on a webpage.

Audio and Video Support:- HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the <audio> and <video> elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

Canvas:- The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D graphics, making it easier to create interactive graphics and animations on webpages.

SVG Support:- HTML5 includes native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), enabling the creation of resolution-independent vector graphics within webpages.

Geolocation API:- HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows websites to request and access the user's geographical location, enabling location-based services.

Local Storage:- The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs provide a way to store data locally on the user's device, making it easier to create offline web applications and improve performance.

Web Storage:- HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which provide a way to store key-value pairs in the browser, improving data management and persistence.

Web Workers:- Web Workers allow for multi-threading in JavaScript, enabling background processing to improve the responsiveness of web applications.

WebSockets:- HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, which enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, facilitating real-time communication between a web server and a client.

Form Enhancements:- HTML5 introduced new input types such as email, url, date, and number, as well as attributes like placeholder and required to improve form handling and validation.

Drag-and-Drop:- HTML5 provides native support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to create user-friendly interfaces for tasks like file uploading.

Responsive Images:- The srcset and sizes attributes allow web developers to provide multiple image resources for different screen sizes and resolutions, helping to improve the loading speed and quality of images.

New APIs:- HTML5 introduced various JavaScript APIs, such as the History API, Web Storage API, Web Notifications API, and more, to enable advanced web application functionality.

Offline Application Cache:- HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) API, which allows web applications to work offline by caching resources and assets.

Cross-document Messaging:- HTML5 provides a secure way for documents from different origins to communicate with the postMessage API, enabling cross-origin communication.

Improved Accessibility:- HTML5 includes features like ARIA landmarks and roles, which improve the accessibility of web content for people with disabilities.

Improved Parsing Rules:- HTML5 has more consistent parsing rules, making it easier for browsers to handle malformed markup gracefully.
